# This is just a sample config file for Twitter app credentials.
# You need to add these from your Twitter app settings.
# 
# It is STRONGLY recommended that you add credentials in this order:
#   * rename this file to 'credentials.py'
#   * add 'credentials.py' to .gitignore
#   * modify 'credentials.py' to include your Twitter secret info

# Twitter calls this the API Key
consumer_key    = 'example'
# Twitter calls this the API Key - Secret
consumer_secret = 'example'
# Twitter calls this the Bearer Token
bearer_token    = 'example'

# Note: to allow yourself write access for RT/Likes, you must 
# change your OAuth settings by enabling OAuth 1.0 and enabling read/
# write permissions. 

# It is advised to generate access_token/access_token_secret after you 
# change OAuth permissions. Otherwise, you will need to regenerate.
access_token    = 'example'
access_token_secret = 'example'
